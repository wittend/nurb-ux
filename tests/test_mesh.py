"""A mesh becomes a part's solid only where that is honest.

build123d's `import_stl` returns a `Face`, and subtracting from one segfaults instead
of raising. A part builds inside the `nurb dev` process, so the whole watcher dies with
no traceback: the one failure here that leaves no evidence. These tests pin both halves.
The flat-faced case comes back as a real solid that chamfers, and every other mesh is
refused in words that name what to run instead. Three of those refusals exist because
the mesh converts perfectly well and the result is silently wrong: an open surface gets
a volume, an inverted one runs its booleans backwards, a degenerate one encloses
nothing.
