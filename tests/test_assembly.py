"""Assemblies: the sweep must find the jam the printability rules cannot see.

The fixture geometry is chosen so the jam angle is analytic, not observed: a flap
hinged along the edge of a slab it lies flat against can rise and swing over its own
hinge, and the first material interference is at exactly 180 degrees, when its
trailing face crosses into the slab's quadrant. Downward it interferes immediately.
No tolerance in these tests was tuned to make them pass.
