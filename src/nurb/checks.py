def concave_cosmetic(shape, ctx):
    """Polish laid into an inside corner instead of across an outside one.

    A cosmetic chamfer belongs on a convex edge, where it takes a sharp corner off. Run
    over a concave one it does the opposite: it adds a thin wedge into the corner,
    which prints as a feather edge and collects stress where the part is already
    weakest. A concave junction that needs relieving wants a deliberate structural
    chamfer sized for the load, not the polish pass.

    Found by shape rather than by trying to identify chamfers: a strip about as wide as
    the polish pass makes, whose long edges are all concave, is one. Width comes from
    area over perimeter, which is the honest measure for a strip and does not care how
    the strip is oriented.

    **About as wide as the polish pass makes, not merely narrow.** A chamfer of length s
    across a right-angled corner leaves a strip s * sqrt(2) wide, so the window is that
    figure with a little headroom, and the limit was twice it until two parts showed
    what twice costs. A 2mm structural chamfer, which is what the doctrine prescribes
    for a concave junction in thin material, leaves a 2.6mm strip; the 2mm of wall left
    standing between two of them measures 1.9mm. Both sat under a 2.8mm limit, so the
    rule fired six times at `mount_tape_measure` and again at `mount_akrobin_rail`, at
    the exact geometry its own message tells you to use. A deliberate relief is bigger
    than polish, and being bigger is the only thing that distinguishes it.

    The cost is a polish chamfer in a shallow concave junction, past about 105 degrees,
    where the strip a 1mm chamfer leaves is wide enough to read as deliberate. That is
    the right way round to be wrong: `polish_edges` vetoes concave edges outright, so
    this rule is the backstop for a part that rolls its own selector, and a backstop
    that cries wolf at correct geometry gets switched off.

    up to 1/0.3 of the true section at its own exit filter's floor. So any chord thin
    enough that the true section might still be under `min_wall` gets refined by
    `_sphere_at`, which measures the way a wall is actually thin, perpendicular to
    nothing in particular. The gate follows from the filter rather than being tuned: an
    accepted chord leaves within the 0.3 cosine floor, so a chord past `min_wall / 0.3`
    cannot be hiding a failing section, and the sphere is only paid for where it could
    matter. That also prices `min_wall = 0`, the card's way of saying "this rule cannot
    measure this part", at nothing.

    Two caveats survive the correction, and live on cards rather than in code:

    - A taper reads as a wall. Near the tip of a designed knife edge every section is
      short, sphere and chord alike. The gridfinity shelves' sockets measure 0.84mm
      where their 45 degree walls meet, and their cards allow 0.7 next to the sentence
      saying why.
    - A relief reads as a wall. The calibration coupon's raised label is 0.5mm proud,
      and that is what gets measured, so its card sets `min_wall = 0`.

    Probes sample faces, so a pinch nothing lands near is still missed. Treat a clean
    result as "no thin walls found", not as "no thin walls".
